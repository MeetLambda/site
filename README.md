# Meetlamba site

Work in progress to sort out how to use `gatsby` in order to generate a static site deployable using excellent (and very generous) `netlify` service


## Main challenges

- tame `gatsby` ðŸ¤ª
- sort out an effective way to deploy a single site, including pages managed in different repositories (eg. sample applications like `2048`)
