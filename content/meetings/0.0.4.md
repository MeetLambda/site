Another iMeetup, but this time it's not an extra one! It's one of the regular ones!

We kept working on [purescript_first_steps](https://github.com/MeetLambda/purescript_first_steps), but following the book "Finding Success and Failure" by Julie Moronuki and Chris Martin. It's a book thought for Haskell, but the principles explained and the exercises are applicable to Purescript too.
