This meeting was held on Liberation's Day, a national festivity in Italy: usually there are manifestations, but given the lockdown everyone was home with free time to work on Purescript!

We worked a bit on our version of (purescript-coeercible)[[https://github.com/MeetLambda/purescript-coercible]], that is now working and passing the tests!

After that we started looking at lenses, using the book "Lenses for the Mere Mortal - Purescript Edition" by Brian Marick..
