This was the second iMeetup. It was a "bonus" one: given the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy, we decided to double down on our meetings, so after barely a week we found ourselves together (virtually, of course) working on our [purescript_first_steps](https://github.com/MeetLambda/purescript_first_steps).

We had some new faces with us, so we backtracked a bit and looked again to what we did in the previous meeting. We also looked at new things: they weren't easy, but we managed!

Thanks to Filippo Bosi, in the [purescript_first_steps](https://github.com/MeetLambda/purescript_first_steps) README there is now an explanation on how to get a working Purescript environment using Docker.
