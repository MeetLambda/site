In this meetup we continued reading "Finding Success and Failure" and working on our [first steps](https://github.com/MeetLambda/purescript_first_steps).

In particular we worked on the Coercible and Newtype type classes.

In Haskell Coercible is in the base package, but not in Purescript. We found [Thimoteus](https://github.com/Thimoteus/purescript-coercible)'s version on [pursuit](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-coercible/3.0.0), but it was a bit old and missed some features we required (the Newtype related ones).

You can found the upgraded version, compatible with Purescript version 0.13, [here](https://github.com/MeetLambda/purescript-coercible). It also has some new features related to Newtypes.
