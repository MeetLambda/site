During this meetup we looked closer at the [SimpleCalculator](https://github.com/MeetLambda/simpleCalculator) project to compare closer Halogen and Concur implementations of the UI part.

Later we focused on the few tests still failing; to help us think about how to fix the tests we have enhanced the testing machinery to provide a 'tracing' method that will print out in the console the internal state of the calculator at each step.

We do not have fixed the tests yet, but we have practice a little more on how to handle effects. :)
