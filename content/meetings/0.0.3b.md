The third iMeetup, and still a bonus one! 

This time, we spent a bit of time talking about Docker and purescript containers: thanks to Filippo Bosi our purescript container was cleaned and improved, you can still found it [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/gior/purescriptwithspago). The Dockerfile can be found [here](https://github.com/Gio-R/docker-purescript).

After that, we continued our first steps: records, pattern matching, FFI... Go check the [results](https://github.com/MeetLambda/purescript_first_steps)!

In this session we saw  that:
* in Purescript you can define row types (also called records), that are the equivalent of the Javascript objects. In fact the syntax to create one is the same.

  In order to define a row type you can use the constructor syntax:
  ```
  type Person = Record ( name :: String, interests :: Array String )
  ``` 

  or a syntactic sugar:
  ```
  type Person = { name :: String, interests :: Array String }
  ```

  and then you can define a value of that type:
  ```
  benHur :: Person
  benHur = { name: "Ben Hur", interests: ["Jogging"]}
  ```
  
  Among the other things you can do with the records is to define open records (where you define only a subset of the fields) and you can do pattern matching on them.
