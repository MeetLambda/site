The first iMeetup! We used Zoom to see each other, and the Live Share extension for VS Code to code together. All in all, it was a good experience!

We continued working on our [first steps](https://github.com/MeetLambda/purescript_first_steps),
 and slowly but surely our understanding of Purescript is growing!

Some of our members had problems installing a Purescript environment (complete with Spago) on their machine, so a containerized solution was proposed: it can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/gior/purescriptwithspago).
